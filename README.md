# Fire District and Drinking Water Service Area Analysis

## Project Overview

The geographic area served by a drinking water system often does not align perfectly with the political boundaries of fire districts or municipalities. Currently, the extent of properties within water districts that are **not served** by fire districts is not fully known.  

This project aims to address this gap by conducting a **pilot mapping project**. Specifically, we will reach out to select fire districts to map their current political boundaries and compare them to drinking water service areas. Service areas are defined by property parcels that intersect drinking water lines, as visualized in this [ANR map](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/978310184fd2420bb682b26c8a32afab).

## Metrics

The analysis will focus on the following metrics:  

1. **Area Difference** – The spatial difference between the political boundaries of each fire district and the properties served by the water system (as shown in the ANR map).  
2. **Coverage Percentage** – The proportion of the town’s area (as defined by VCGI town boundaries) that falls within the fire district. Town boundary data is available [here](https://geodata.vermont.gov/datasets/VCGI::vt-data-town-boundaries-1/about).
